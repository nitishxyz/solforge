# SolForge - Lightweight Solana RPC Server

## Vision

SolForge is a high-performance, lightweight drop-in replacement for `solana-test-validator` built on LiteSVM. Our goal is to provide developers with a fast, resource-efficient local Solana development environment that "just works."

## What We're Building

### Core Objectives

1. **Drop-in Replacement**: Full compatibility with existing Solana RPC clients and tools
2. **Blazing Fast**: Sub-second startup, minimal memory footprint (~50MB vs 500MB+)
3. **Developer First**: Zero configuration, intuitive architecture, easy to extend
4. **Production Ready**: Reliable, well-tested, suitable for CI/CD pipelines

### Key Features

- âœ… **Full RPC Compatibility**: Implement all standard Solana JSON-RPC methods
- âš¡ **In-Memory Execution**: No disk I/O, no ledger storage overhead
- ðŸ”§ **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new methods and features
- ðŸ§ª **Testing Optimized**: Perfect for unit tests, integration tests, and local development
- ðŸ“¦ **Tiny Footprint**: Minimal dependencies, fast installation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Bun Native**: Built specifically for Bun's performance characteristics

## Architecture

```
SolForge
â”œâ”€â”€ Core Server (LiteSVM wrapper)
â”œâ”€â”€ RPC Method Handlers (modular)
â”œâ”€â”€ State Management (in-memory)
â””â”€â”€ Extensions (plugins, custom programs)
```

### Design Principles

1. **Modularity Over Monoliths**: Small, focused modules that do one thing well
2. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed and resource usage
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear code, good documentation, helpful errors
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new RPC methods and custom behavior
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain strict Solana RPC API compatibility

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core RPC Methods âœ…
- Basic account operations
- Transaction submission and simulation
- Block and slot information
- System queries

### Phase 2: Extended RPC Methods (Current)
- Token operations
- Program deployment
- Stake operations
- Vote operations
- Advanced queries

### Phase 3: WebSocket Support
- Subscription methods
- Real-time updates
- Account notifications
- Transaction confirmations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Snapshot/restore functionality
- Time travel debugging
- Custom program loader
- Performance profiling tools
- Multi-tenant support

### Phase 5: Production Features
- Clustering support
- Persistent storage option
- Metrics and monitoring
- Admin API
- Plugin system

## Use Cases

### Primary
- Local development environment
- Unit and integration testing
- CI/CD pipeline testing
- Educational purposes

### Secondary
- Performance benchmarking
- Protocol experimentation
- Custom program development
- Lightweight staging environments

## Success Metrics

- **Startup Time**: < 1 second
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB idle, < 200MB under load
- **RPC Compatibility**: 100% core methods, 80%+ extended methods
- **Developer Adoption**: Primary choice for local Solana development
- **Test Speed**: 10x faster than solana-test-validator

## Non-Goals

- Not a production validator replacement
- Not for mainnet/testnet operation
- Not for consensus participation
- Not for long-term data persistence

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (exclusively)
- **Core**: LiteSVM
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Modular, event-driven
- **Testing**: Bun test framework
- **Package Management**: Bun

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that align with our vision of a fast, lightweight, developer-friendly Solana RPC server. See AGENTS.md for development guidelines.

## Why "SolForge"?

Like a forge shapes raw metal into useful tools, SolForge shapes the Solana runtime into a powerful development tool - hot, fast, and ready to create.
