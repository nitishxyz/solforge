# Installation Path Correction

## Summary

The installation path has been corrected throughout all documentation from `~/.solforge/bin/` to `~/.local/bin/` to match the actual implementation in `scripts/install.sh`.

## Corrected Path

✅ **Correct**: `~/.local/bin/` or `$HOME/.local/bin/`  
❌ **Incorrect**: `~/.solforge/bin/`

## Rationale

The existing `scripts/install.sh` installs the Solforge binary to `~/.local/bin/`, which is:

1. **Standard**: `~/.local/bin/` is the conventional location for user-installed binaries on Linux/macOS
2. **PATH-friendly**: Many distributions automatically include `~/.local/bin/` in PATH
3. **Existing behavior**: Maintains compatibility with current installation process

## Implementation

The installer package (`packages/install/index.ts`) now correctly uses:

```typescript
const installDir = join(homedir(), ".local", "bin");
```

## PATH Setup

Users should add to their shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Files Updated

- ✅ `docs/MONOREPO_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`
- ✅ `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- ✅ `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`

All references to `.solforge/bin` have been replaced with `.local/bin`.
